My code can be compiled with the command
    $ make compile

and run with the command
    $ make run

    or

    $ ./main [instructors.txt] [students.txt]


Additional Changes to the project:
I modifed the login method to include a parameter for the
input text file so that the login method could read the
text file that was inputted into the command line arguement

I modifed all the methods that returned a Student object in
the Instructor class to return a pointer to a Student object.
I just happen to find that the syntax of reading pointers to
objects easier for myself
    
I also placed all the data that was read from the text file into
a 2D array that I could pass around to my Instructor and Student
objects, so many methods in the Instructor class include and extra
2D array parameter that made it easier for me to access data

Finally, I also modifed most methods to include a size or row
parameter. This allows for differing size text files to be read
rather than just hard coding the number 20 into my program.
